# ðŸ“¦ Logistics Company â€“ Web Application

The **Logistics Company** web application streamlines parcel delivery management. The company operates multiple offices and employs **couriers** (who handle deliveries) and **office staff** (who assist customers). Customers can send and receive parcels either from company offices or to a specific address, with pricing based on weight and delivery location. Employees have full visibility of all shipments, while customers can only track their own sent, received, or expected parcels.
