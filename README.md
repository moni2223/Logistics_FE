# ðŸ“¦ Logistics Company â€“ Web Application

The **Logistics Company** web application streamlines parcel delivery management. The company operates multiple offices and employs **couriers** (who handle deliveries) and **office staff** (who assist customers). Customers can send and receive parcels either from company offices or to a specific address, with pricing based on weight and delivery location. Employees have full visibility of all shipments, while customers can only track their own sent, received, or expected parcels.

To enhance performance, the project uses Vite, a modern frontend build tool that provides ultra-fast development and hot module replacement (HMR). Unlike traditional bundlers, Vite optimizes the development workflow by pre-building dependencies and leveraging native ES modules, resulting in blazing-fast startup times.

ðŸ”¥ Why Vite?
Instant Server Start â€“ No more waiting for Webpack to bundle everything.
Faster Hot Reloading â€“ Changes reflect immediately in the browser.
Optimized Build Process â€“ Uses esbuild for lightning-fast compilation.
By using React + Vite, the project benefits from a modern, fast, and efficient development experience. ðŸš€
